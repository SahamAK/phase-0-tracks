#Release 1: Study Up#

## After an Hour of research##
I spent an hour readig JQuery on w3schools.com. I read and executed the examples. The progress was slow but I was able to understand jQuery effects and HTML. 
I took an hour break and decided to come back but this time I looked up on YouTube for Jquery tutorial. I found "LearnCode.academy". I watched the first 5 videos. It is a fast pace but I was able to see things in action. I did this for an hour.

I think the combination of reading and watching did give me a better understanding of jQuery. Seeing it in action made it easier. I also found a great source to go back to and follow on YouTube.
