# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
	*Version control is a way to keep track of the changes made to files.
		* be able to track who made changes
		* when they were introduced
		* be able to go back to before the changes where made

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
	* A branch is to creat a copy of the original directory in git.
		* This will provide you with an area where you can make updates
		* You can add the changes o your branch without disturbing the master branch
		* The master branch is not effected with your changes until you commit
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
	* Git commit is recording the changes to the repository.
	* A good commit message is one that is not generic and gives enough detail about the changes made to a file.

* What is a merge conflict?
	* sometimes the process of merging changes does not go smoothly. If you changes the same part in two or more different branches or if another team member has updated the same code, Git won't be able to merge them. That is when you get a "conflict" message when you run merge. You need to reslove the issue before proceeding with the merge.

* I am adding this section for Release 2.
* I am adding this comment to resubmit this file.
