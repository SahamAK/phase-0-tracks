		<h1>Why we need a <em>dog</em>?</h1>
		<img src="mydog.jpeg" alt="DOG">
		<p> Dogs are Humans' best friends. My children have been asking to get a dog for a while now. But their dad does <strong>not</strong> want to have a dog because: </p>
			<ul>
				<li> he is allergic to fur.
				<li> a dog bit Him when he was a kid
				<li> we have carpet on the floor
			</ul>

		<p> He also have the following concerns if we get a dog: </p>
			<ol>
				<li> how long does it take to train a dog?
				<li> who will walk the dog?
				<li> how often do we need to walk the dog?
				<li> who will walk the dog when it is freezing outside?
				<li> do you think you will not argue who's turn it is to walk the dog?
				<li> etc.
			</ol>
